# AnomalyDetection

This is a project from an Advanced 1 programming course, The project is the server-side for an anomaly detection service. given flight statistics, it can find anomalies using basic probability formulas. In this project I used Threading- in order to be able to handle a few clients, several OOP design patterns such as strategy command and bridge, I used TCP communication to allow the client to with the server. feel free to download the files and change the main as you want, and then run the main using an IDE or cmd.
